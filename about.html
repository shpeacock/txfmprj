																					Every Texan family deserves affordable and quality healthcare. The lack of preventative medicine and quality care has a drastic effect on our labor force leaving our families at risk of economic hardship.  Our hospitals are burdened with uncompensated care from catastrophic illnesses and traumas, this prevents Texas from providing the necessary resources to care for you and your family.
Women’s healthcare has been under siege.  Governor Abbott and the Texas legislature have created numerous barriers for women to obtain essential healthcare needs, including access to birth control and life saving cancer screenings. Because of this assault on women’s health maternal mortality rates in Texas rival those in third world countries.  Due to the failed policies in Austin mothers are dying at astronomical rates leaving behind children that are many times forced to rely on our government for financial support or worse yet, have to be placed in our broken foster care system.
The Texas Legislature has a moral responsibility to expand Medicaid, eliminate the coverage gap, fully fund Planned Parenthood and other women’s health initiatives, and ensure every Texan has the health insurance they deserve

        Texas families need the opportunity to grow and flourish in a safe environment without the fear of violence or discrimination.  Texas has one of the highest rates of both human trafficking and missing children in the country.  Nearly 200 children went missing across the state last year.  While some are returned to their families thanks to the efforts of law enforcement and programs like the Amber Alert system, many are never found and end up being trafficked domestically or taken to other countries.  Statewide studies estimate that there are over 300,000 victims of human trafficking in Texas.  This criminal activity destroys lives and families.  If our legislators are truly serious about protecting Texans from criminals they must also institute adequate funding for the statewide backlog of untested rape kits.  We can no longer allow rapists to attack victims for years while the state holds the evidence to convict them. Too many of our residents face struggles because of a lack of basic infrastructure and access to necessities.  The Texas Water Development Board needs more funding to connect hundreds of towns to clean water access.  Also, many of our low income areas have sparse access to fresh quality food.  Measures to assist these food desert communities have recently been shot down in the state legislature.  Legislators must consider these measures again in the next session including targeted community projects, and vendor partnerships.

				Over the last four years Texans have watched our state drop from the 8th largest economy in the world to the 13th.  More Texans work minimum wage jobs than any other state.  Many working families in Texas have to keep more than one job just to afford rent and utilities.  Meanwhile, our state has been making it harder for families to achieve economic stability because our legislature continues to shift the state’s financial burden away from multi-billion dollar corporations and puts it squarely in the laps of working Texans.
It is time Texas learns from our mistakes and corrects the course of our state economy.  Through targeted public spending, workers rights expansion, equal pay for equal work for all Texans, and paid pregnancy and family leave, we can restore the Texas miracle and become the economic leader we once were.

				"Immigration is an integral part of Texas history. Currently immigrants make up 17% of our population. These Texas families are a vibrant and vital part of communities across our state. Yet our attorney general has decided to sue the federal government to end the DACA program along with 6 other states. This is a threat to their well-being and will tear apart these families. This is cruel and a danger to our economy. In addition, the SB4 bill was passed and upheld by challenges in our appeals court. This bill allows law enforcement officers to detain and question the immigration status of our citizens, and punish local governments for not cooperating with these officers in their attempt to safeguard families.  These Texas families need to be protected while comprehensive immigration reform is addressed.
Another group of families under severe attack in Texas are our LGBTQ+ citizens. There were no less than 24 bills introduced in our last legislative session that infringe on their rights. The bathroom bill, or SB6, drew the most attention and the most criticism from both the ACLU and leaders in the business and tourism industry predicting a huge negative effect on our economy. Other bills allow discrimination against LGBTQ+ families in their workplaces and as they acquire marriage licenses and adopt children, all under the guise of respecting religious freedom.  All Texas families must be afforded equal protection and fair treatment.

									Texans have always been committed to a strong public education system.  In 1826 our forefathers listed the lack of public education as one of the reasons to declare independence from Mexico. We must continue this legacy of strength through education to ensure future generations have the necessary tools to succeed.
However, our state legislators continuously write short-sighted fiscal policy with no regard for the future.  The Robin Hood school finance program has left our school districts in financial danger.  At the same time families across the state are suffocated under the heavy burden of property taxes.
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) refuses to provide the funding for our necessary programs. Students who need special education account for 13% of enrollment but the TEA penalizing districts that identify more than 8.5% of enrollment as students who need special education. By not giving these students the tools they need we have left them struggling with poor reading and math skills and jeopardize their chances to graduate and become productive adults.

																				Texans have a proud tradition of serving in the military of the United States. They put their lives on the line for us.  If they become disabled, either physically or mentally, we have an obligation to do everything we can to help them. Far too many of our veterans are not getting the mental health care they need to transition back to civilian life. PTSD is a particular problem. The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that the are between 130,000 to 200,000 homeless veterans on any given night, representing between 1/5 to 1/4 of all homeless people. When a service member is suffering from PTSD, it puts a strain on their family. Providing in-home caregiver support would greatly ease this stress. The VA reports that after adjusting for age and gender, the suicide risk for veterans is 22% higher than for non-veterans. On average, we lose 20 veterans a day to suicide. Of that 20, 14 were not under VA care. We simply must do more. The VA must have the funding and support to provide the care our veterans need. There are over 30,000 positions at the VA that the Trump Administration has left unfilled. While using civilian facilities to resolve bottlenecks in care may be necessary at times, most civilian clinics are not equipped to give our vets the help they need, especially mental health care. The recently enacted VA Mission Act is a good plan, but it should not be used as a way to privatize the VA. Many fear that the use of the private sector will drain much needed resources from the VA.  The Texas Veterans Commission was set up to help Texas veterans navigate what can be a very complicated VA system. Making sure it is fully funded is a vital necessity. The Hazlewood Act provides qualified veterans, spouses, and dependent children with an education benefit of up to 150 hours of tuition exemption at public institutions of higher education in Texas. This act represents a promise we have made to those who enter the military from Texas and it should be fully funded. It should not be watered down just to save money.  A promise is a promise. Our active duty military, guard members, and reservists sacrifice greatly for us. We need to make sure we provide them and their families with all the help they need.
